### What this is for

The purpose of this repository is to be the dumping grounds for various small snippets of code / small projects I've done for practice, for exploration and/or out of curiosity.

### A quick overview
An overview of the scripts in the repository and what they do. 

- [siteWithLogin]()
`Website strictly for learning PHP and mySQL. Has sign-up, login and a landing page. Users are created and stored in an SQL database from signed form data. When logging in, the database is checked for the input credentials. Landing page is a user-specific site where a given user can type in text and change the background colour, updating their personal site.`

- [PullTheTriggerGame]()
`Best of three - counts down from 10, stops at a random count, at which point you have to press a button within a grace period or you lose the round.`

- [RPG_Game](https://github.com/Sornis/Small_programs/tree/main/RPGGame/RPGGame)
`The game has you enter a name on starting up (if a name isn't input, resort to a default value). The code then enters into loop, where you have 
the options to 1: enter a shop, 2: fight in a battleground, 3: quit the game.`

- [VendingMachine](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Small-programs/blob/main/VendingMachine)
`Vending machine WPF application in C#. Has a number of items (objects) stored in arrays - 
Can delete input, and if the input is prefixed with '#', insert that amount of money. You need money inserted to be able to buy an item.`

- [SearchUsername](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/SearchUsername.py)
`Function that takes a string input, searches a file for matches and returns whether the file contains the string or not`

- [CheckDivisors](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/CheckDivisors.py)
`Lists every divisor of a user defined number`
- [CheckYesNo](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/CheckYesNo.py)
`Experiment with nested while loops - outer loop terminates based on conditions in the inner loop`
- [GuessANumber](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/GuessANumber.py)
`Guess-a-number game: programs selects a number based on a user specified number range (ie., from 1-100). When the user guesses the correct number, they're prompted if they want to keep playing or if they want to exit.`
- [HundredCalc](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/HundredCalc.py)
`The user inputs their age, and the computer outputs the year they'll turn 100`
- [ListElements](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/ListElements.py)
`User inputs a number - the program iterates over an array, and appends any element that is <= the user defined number to another array`
- [MixedArray](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/MixedArray.py)
`Program loops through an array containing various different data types, and only outputs the numbers`
- [OddOrEven](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/OddOrEven.py)
`Checks an input number for whether it's odd or even using the modulus operator`
- [OverlapLists](https://github.com/BarrelrollBob/Snippets/blob/main/OverlapLists.py)
`Generates two random arrays: loops through one of them and compares each index with the elements of the other. If the values are 'equal' or 'duplicate', append the value to another array`
